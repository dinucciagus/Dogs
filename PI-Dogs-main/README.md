# Individual Project - Dogs App

<img height="150" src="./logo.png" />

## Description

This App is an individual project, built in three weeks using React, Redux, Node, Express and Sequelize - Postgres. As a version controller I used git and gitHub. It consumes the information from the external Api : https://thedogapi.com/ and stores in the data-base only the dogs created by the client. The styles of the App were made in CSS without wireframes, prototypes or external libraries. The design is responsive so it can be watch on smartphones or desktops. The deployment for the backend was done with Heroku,
the data-base with Heroku-Postgres and for the Frontend with Vercel.

The funtionalities of this App are:

- See the list of dogs breeds with their respective characteristics on the main page divided in pages with the paging that has previus and next buttons and an input .
- Search for a specific one by typing the name on the search bar.
- Order all dogs alphabetically (ascendent and descendent)
- Order all dogs by weight (ascendent and descendent).
- Filter all dogs by the origin (if it is created by the client or cames from the Api).
- Filter all dogs by Temperaments.
- Create a new breed of dogs.
- Delete a created breed.
- See the details of a specific breed.
